## Overview

The objective of this repository is to provide a practical understanding of essential data structures and algorithms. Each implementation is accompanied by code comments to facilitate comprehension.

## Data Structures Implemented

- **Arrays:** Basic operations and usage (`Array.c`)
- **Linked Lists:**
  - Single Linked List (`SingleLinkedList.c`)
  - Polynomial representation using Single Linked List (`PolynomialUsingSLL.c`)
- **Stacks:**
  - Array-based implementation (`Stack.c`)
  - Linked List-based implementation (`StackUsingSLL.c`)
  - Infix to Postfix conversion (`InfixToPostfix.c`)
  - Postfix expression evaluation (`PostfixEvaluation.c`)
- **Queues:**
  - Linear Queue (`LinearQueue.c`)
  - Circular Queue (`CircularQueue.c`)
  - Linked List-based Queue (`QueueUsingSLL.c`)
  - Reversing a Queue (`reverseQueue.c`)
- **Trees:** Basic operations and traversal (`Tree.c`)

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Searching Algorithms:**
  - Linear Search (`Search.c`)
  - Binary Search (`binarySearch.c`)
  - Interpolation Search (`interpolationSearch.c`)
- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Insertion Sort (`InsertionSort.c`)
  - Selection Sort (`SelectionSort.c`)
  - Merge Sort (`MergeSort.c`)
  - Quick Sort (`QuickSort.c`)

## Getting Started

To explore the implementations:

 **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swarnabhaghosh/DSA-3rd-SEM.git
   cd DSA-3rd-SEM
   ```



*Note: Each `.c` file corresponds to a specific data structure or algorithm implementation. Ensure you have a C compiler installed to run the programs.*
